# Prerequisites (Windows)
You need to have access to the make command, I personally used [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

# Rename
To rename change:
- The project folder name
- The .code-workspace file name
- The "proj_name" value inside of (.vscode/settings.json)

# Configure unix shell
This template was made for windows using WSL so you may have to explicitly set your shells path if in a different configuration. This can be done by changing the value of "unix_shell_path" inside of (.vscode/settings.json)
